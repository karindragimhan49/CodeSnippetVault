## 🚀 Project Overview: "Code Snippet Vault"

The core application is a "Code Snippet Vault" — a practical tool for developers to save, organize, and retrieve frequently used code snippets. It's built on a modern MERN stack with a professional, user-friendly interface.

### ✨ Key Features

-   **Create, Read, Delete (CRD) Snippets:** Full functionality to manage code snippets.
-   **Project-Based Organization:** Group snippets into different projects (e.g., "E-commerce Site," "Personal Blog").
-   **Dynamic Filtering & Searching:** Instantly filter snippets by project or search by title.
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Clear and readable code blocks for various languages.
-   **Enhanced UX:** Features like loading states, notifications (toasts), and a "copy to clipboard" function provide a polished user experience.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Explained

The heart of this project is the automated deployment pipeline configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

**▶️ Trigger:** The pipeline automatically runs on every `git push` to the `main` branch.

**⚙️ Pipeline Stages:**

1.  **Checkout Code:** The latest code is checked out from the repository.
2.  **Login to Docker Hub:** Securely logs into Docker Hub using encrypted secrets.
3.  **Build Docker Images:** Builds separate, optimized Docker images for the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js) applications.
4.  **Push to Docker Hub:** Tags the newly built images with `:latest` and pushes them to a public Docker Hub repository.
5.  **Deploy via SSH:**
    -   Securely connects to the DigitalOcean Droplet using an SSH key stored in GitHub Secrets.
    -   Pulls the latest images from Docker Hub.
    -   Stops and removes the old running containers to prevent conflicts.
    -   Starts new containers from the updated images, injecting the `MONGO_URI` environment variable into the backend container.

## 🔧 Local Development & Setup

To run this project on your local machine, you'll need Git, Node.js, and Docker Desktop installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karindragimhan49/Containerized-Mern-CICD-Pipeline.git
    cd Containerized-Mern-CICD-Pipeline
    ```

2.  **Create Environment Variables:**
    -   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory.
    -   Create another `.env` file in the project's **root** directory.
    -   Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to **both** files:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        ```

3.  **Run with Docker Compose (Recommended):**
    This method mirrors the production environment.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    -   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    -   Backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

4.  **Run with Node.js (Traditional Method):**
    ```bash
    # Install all dependencies from the root
    npm install concurrently
    cd server && npm install && cd ../client && npm install
    
    # Run both client and server concurrently from the root directory
    cd ..
    npm run dev
    ```
